# Using File Resources

The module shows to build build (`webpack.js`) and use (directory `examples` with sub-dirs) file resources together with Webpack.

The following shall be demonstrated:

* File resources are generated in the structure as given in the webpack config.
* The path to find file resources may be defined at compile time.
* But: The path may be changed directly in the HTML file by using the [plugin webpack-require-from](https://github.com/agoldis/webpack-require-from).
